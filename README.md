· A Manager can hire.

· A Cashier sells products to customers and dispenses receipts("Thank you for shopping with US!")

· Customers can buy products from the store


# How I completed this project?

1. Organize the folders for your module (application), to house both your code base and the tests.

2. Wrote tests to cover all the methods to be written before development begins (TDD: Test Driven Development).

3. Made logical assumptions where necessary.

4. The right visibility modifiers was used.


# The following concepts of OOP

· Encapsulation

· Inheritance

· Polymorphism

· Interfaces/Abstract classes

· Single Responsibility for classes.

· Abstraction

· Aggregation

· Composition

· Generics

· Collections

· Exception Handling


5. Test Coverage (~80%)


 The tests cover the methods as well as the conditions/procedures that the methods employ.
